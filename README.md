# Predictive Modeling Task
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using Python and libraries such as **Scikit-Learn**. The goal is to create a model that predicts the likelihood of a certain outcome based on features from a dataset. In this project, we develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on health-related features.

## Project Overview
- **Task Description**: Use machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and predict outcomes.
- **Example Objective**: Predict the probability of a person having diabetes based on input features like age, glucose levels, BMI, etc.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset into Python for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or null values.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
   - Scale and normalize data where necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select the most relevant features for prediction.
   - Encode categorical variables if present.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Use machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine to build a predictive model.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for validation.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
6. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize feature importance and key results.
